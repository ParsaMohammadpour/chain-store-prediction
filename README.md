# chain store prediction
&emsp; This was machine learning 3rd assignment, which was about predicting amount of sales in the next month in a chain store.
We have different .csv files, containing this chain store information, which they had a relation to each other by foreign key. Using this datasets, we predicted the amount of sales of each store in the next month. 
Explanations are fully provided in [this](https://github.com/ParsaMohammadpour/chain-store-prediction/blob/main/chain-store-prediction.ipynb) file.
